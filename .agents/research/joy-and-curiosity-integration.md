# Joy & Curiosity Integration Ideas

**Source:** [Joy & Curiosity #72](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-72) by Thorsten Ball

## Key Concepts That Resonate

1. **"Doing the thing is doing the thing"** — action over endless planning
2. **"This is the part that really counts"** — embrace the present moment of building, not some future "ready" state
3. **"Build an agent, give it bash, throw problems at it"** — hands-on experimentation as the path to understanding

## Integration Options (Minimal → Maximal)

### Option A: Tiny Copy Tweak (5 min)
Adjust hero description to subtly echo the philosophy:

**Current:**
> "One command to set up PRDs, plans, and autonomous execution loops in any codebase."

**Proposed:**
> "One command to set up PRDs, plans, and an execution loop—so you can start building, not just planning."

### Option B: Add Install Hint (5 min)
Under the install command, add:
> "Then point your agent at a real problem and iterate."

### Option C: Small "Inspiration" Section (30 min)
Add after quickstart, before CTA:

```html
<section class="inspiration" id="inspiration">
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p class="inspiration-desc">
    A mindset we like: <em>doing the thing is doing the thing</em> — ship, observe, iterate.
  </p>
  <ul class="inspiration-links">
    <li>
      <a href="https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-72">
        Thorsten Ball — "Joy & Curiosity #72"
      </a>
      <span class="muted">(recommended reading)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

## Recommendation

Start with **Option A** (copy tweak) to make the philosophy felt immediately. If you want to credit the source explicitly, add **Option C** as a small section. Avoid over-quoting or turning the landing page into content.
